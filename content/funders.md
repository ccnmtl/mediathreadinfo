<p>Mediathread was initially conceived and piloted during a three-year, IMLS-funded partnership with WGBH’s Media Archive and Libraries focused on academic use at Columbia University of WGBH Vietnam War documentary footage (2008-2011). As a result, WGBH’s&nbsp;<a href="http://openvault.wgbh.org/">OpenVault</a>&nbsp;was one of the first multimedia collections available to instructors and students on the open web to be compatible with Mediathread’s bookmarklet.&nbsp;For more information, see Project Vietnam: Video Archive and Annotation Tool (2010) at&nbsp;<a href="http://ccnmtl.columbia.edu/projectvietnam/">http://ccnmtl.columbia.edu/projectvietnam/</a>.</p>
<h2>National Science Foundation (NSF)</h2>
<p class="p1">Mediathread developed at Columbia University out of the NSF-funded <i>VITAL: Early Childhood Mathematics Education</i> project (2003-2009). This project conceptualized and implemented a learning environment that would consist of a digital library and videos contained within an online community workspace.&nbsp; A series of evaluations of learning outcomes were conducted under the NSF grant.
