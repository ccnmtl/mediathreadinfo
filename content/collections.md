<img height="160" width="160" style="float: left;" class="media-element file-default collections-image" src="/images/wgbhopenvault.jpg" alt="" title="">
<p>Mediathread was initially conceived and piloted during a three-year, IMLS-funded partnership with WGBH’s Media Archive and Libraries focused on academic use at Columbia University of WGBH Vietnam War documentary footage. As a result, WGBH’s <a href="http://openvault.wgbh.org/">OpenVault</a> was one of the first multimedia collections available to instructors and students on the open web to be compatible with Mediathread’s bookmarklet. WGBH has also been instrumental in conversations about the applicability of Open Annotation Data modeling in Mediathread, and ways that Mediathread can surface aggregate information about content use to digital library producers.</p>

<h2>ARTStor</h2>

<p>ARTStor has been an important early supporter of Mediathread, collaborating with CCNMTL developers to ensure bookmarklet compatibility with ARTStor image viewers and tools. As a result, instructors have been able to incorporate ARTStor content and metadata into assignments, and students have experienced the value of working with high quality scholarly resources within a flexible analysis environment. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This early partnership has allowed Mediathread and ARTStor to model course-driven, platform-agnostic assignments that mix source materials from premium databases and the open web.
